Redstrap theme
==============

Licensing
---------

This theme is intended to work with Friendica Red (MIT license). It's based on Twitter's Bootstrap (Apache license).

Redstrap itself is currently under the MIT license.

Status
------

It's a work in progress. Most basic aspects should be working, but it lacks quite a bit of polish here and there. It's expected to work on Red's latest git.

Installation
------------

The 'redstrap' should be cloned into Red's /view/theme/ directory as "redstrap".
